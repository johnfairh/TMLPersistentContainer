/// A container for a Core Data stack that provides automatic multi-step shortest-path
/// persistent store migration, capable of managing both CloudKit-backed and non-cloud stores.
///
/// This is a drop-in replacement for `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` that
/// automatically detects and performs multi-step store migration as part of the
/// `loadPersistentStores(...)` method.
///
/// The container searches for models and mapping models, then constructs the
/// best sequence in which to migrate stores. It prefers to use explicit mapping models
/// over inferred mapping models when there is a choice. Progress and status can be
/// reported back to the client code.
///
/// See [the user guide](https://johnfairh.github.io/TMLPersistentContainer/usage.html) for more details.
///
/// See `PersistentContainer` for a version that does not support CloudKit-backed stores.
