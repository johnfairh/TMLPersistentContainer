# Background

*This document is background on the Core Data
migration-from-multiple-model-versions problem. If you are a developer who
uses Core Data and knows all about this then you should probably [read the user
guide instead](Usage.md).*

Developers change their Core Data models over time to support new requirements.
If a user upgrades the app on their device and the new version of the app has a
new version of the Core Data model then the app's Core Data stores have to be
*migrated* to match the new version of the model.  

A Core Data *mapping model* contains rules to migrate a store from one version
of a model to another. Developers create explicit mapping models in Xcode
or can rely on inferred mapping models created at run-time by Core Data for
simple model changes. These inferred mapping models are usually faster and use
less memory.

Apps have to support migration from all possible installed model versions
otherwise users are stuck unable to upgrade. The standard
`NSPersistentContainer` API allows for a single mapping model to be used when a
store is loaded. This leaves developers with a problem when, for example, they
want to deploy model version 5 that has to support migration from any of the
previous versions 1-4.

**Option 1** is to consider all the possible migrations from versions 1-4 to 5.
If the inferred mapping model is sufficient then great, no problem. If it is
not then the developer has to create a mapping model in Xcode to perform the
necessary transformations.  

**Option 2** is to use multiple sequential migrations at run-time. So if the
user's store happens to be at version 2 then it would first be migrated from
2->3, then 3->4, and finally 4->5.

Option 1 requires more mapping models to be created, tested, and maintained.
It can need more actual code to be written, tested, and maintained depending
on the requirements for custom entity mappings. The benefit is that users see
a single migration step and so the speediest app launch possible.

Option 2 requires some one-off app code to perform the sequential migrations.
Users who have been tardy updating their device see a one-time longer app
launch time after the update as their stores are migrated multiple times.

Option 2 is generally the best choice and several libraries exist to assist
with the mechanics.

This library, `TMLPersistentContainer`, is another such assistant. It allows
developers to minimize the long migration sequences that can occur in mature
apps and to take advantage of the light-weight migrations enabled by inferred
mapping models.
